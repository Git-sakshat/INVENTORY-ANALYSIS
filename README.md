-1st- I will be using some **Power Query** for cleaning and exploring the data to verify everything makes sense. 

-2nd- Next, I’ll work with some manipulations and **DAX** formulas for analyzing the clean information to obtain focused insights. 

-3rd- Finally, I’ll finish by creating some attractive yet informative report pages.
